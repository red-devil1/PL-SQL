-- Experiment 2: Sequence Management 

-- Create a sequence named emp seq with the following specifications:  
-- • Starts at 1000  
-- • Increments by 10  
-- • Has a maximum value of 2000  
-- • Cycles when the max value is reached  

CREATE SEQUENCE employee_seq
START WITH 1000
INCREMENT BY 10
MAXVALUE 2000
CYCLE;

-- SEQUENCE CREATED.

SET SERVEROUT ON;

v_seq_val NUMBER;
BEGIN
FOR i In 1..5 LOOP
SELECT employee_seq.NEXTVAL INTO v_seq_val FROM dual;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Sequence Value ' || i || ': ' || v_seq_val);
END LOOP;
